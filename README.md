A second option to work with fMRI prereg


The R markdown provides a bit more flexibility in how you use the preregistration template. It be used to work within it and more seemlessly include example code. It allows for easy time stamped differences to be tracked if you use git to upload edits of your preregistration. You can also knit the document to a word doc to more easily edit the document (without the formatting issues of the original word document). This provides the option to use an Rmarkdown file to include or exclude the relevant parts of the study design for your preregistration and then knit to an html, pdf or word doc to upload as your prereg doc.
